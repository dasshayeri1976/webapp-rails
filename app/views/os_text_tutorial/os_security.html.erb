<h4>Operating Systems Security</h4>
<p>Security refers to providing a protection system to computer system resources such as CPU, memory, disk, software programs and most importantly data/information stored in the computer system. If a computer program is run by an unauthorized user, then he/she may cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it. So a computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc. We're going to discuss following topics in this chapter.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>One Time passwords</li>
<li>Program Threats</li>
<li>System Threats</li>
<li>Computer Security Classifications</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>Authentication refers to identifying each user of the system and associating the executing programs with those users. It is the responsibility of the Operating System to create a protection system which ensures that a user who is running a particular program is authentic. Operating Systems generally identifies/authenticates users using following three ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Username / Password</b> &minus; User need to enter a registered username and password with Operating system to login into the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>User card/key</b> &minus; User need to punch card in card slot, or enter key generated by key generator in option provided by operating system to login into the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>User attribute - fingerprint/ eye retina pattern/ signature</b> &minus; User need to pass his/her attribute via designated input device used by operating system to login into the system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>One Time passwords</h4>
<p>One-time passwords provide additional security along with normal authentication. In One-Time Password system, a unique password is required every time user tries to login into the system. Once a one-time password is used, then it cannot be used again. One-time password are implemented in various ways.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Random numbers</b> &minus; Users are provided cards having numbers printed along with corresponding alphabets. System asks for numbers corresponding to few alphabets randomly chosen.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Secret key</b> &minus; User are provided a hardware device which can create a secret id mapped with user id. System asks for such secret id which is to be generated every time prior to login.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Network password</b> &minus; Some commercial applications send one-time passwords to user on registered mobile/ email which is required to be entered prior to login.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Program Threats</h4>
<p>Operating system's processes and kernel do the designated task as instructed. If a user program made these process do malicious tasks, then it is known as <b>Program Threats</b>. One of the common example of program threat is a program installed in a computer which can store and send user credentials via network to some hacker. Following is the list of some well-known program threats.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Trojan Horse</b> &minus; Such program traps user login credentials and stores them to send to malicious user who can later on login to computer and can access system resources.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Trap Door</b> &minus; If a program which is designed to work as required, have a security hole in its code and perform illegal action without knowledge of user then it is called to have a trap door.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Logic Bomb</b> &minus; Logic bomb is a situation when a program misbehaves only when certain conditions met otherwise it works as a genuine program. It is harder to detect.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Virus</b> &minus; Virus as name suggest can replicate themselves on computer system. They are highly dangerous and can modify/delete user files, crash systems. A virus is generatlly a small code embedded in a program. As user accesses the program, the virus starts getting embedded in other files/ programs and can make system unusable for user</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>System Threats</h4>
<p>System threats refers to misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble. System threats can be used to launch program threats on a complete network called as program attack. System threats creates such an environment that operating system resources/ user files are misused. Following is the list of some well-known system threats.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Worm</b> &minus; Worm is a process which can choked down a system performance by using system resources to extreme levels. A Worm process generates its multiple copies where each copy uses system resources, prevents all other processes to get required resources. Worms processes can even shut down an entire network.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Port Scanning</b> &minus; Port scanning is a mechanism or means by which a hacker can detects system vulnerabilities to make an attack on the system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Denial of Service</b> &minus; Denial of service attacks normally prevents user to make legitimate use of the system. For example, a user may not be able to use internet if denial of service attacks browser's content settings.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Computer Security Classifications</h4>
<p>As per the U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer System's Evaluation Criteria there are four security classifications in computer systems: A, B, C, and D. This is widely used specifications to determine and model the security of systems and of security solutions. Following is the brief description of each classification.</p>
<div align="center"><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:30%; text-align:center;">S.N.</th>
<th style="width:30%; text-align:center">Classification Type &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><p><b>Type A</b></p>
<p>Highest Level. Uses formal design specifications and verification techniques. Grants a high degree of assurance of process security.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><p><b>Type B</b></p>
<p>Provides mandatory protection system. Have all the properties of a class C2 system. Attaches a sensitivity label to each object. It is of three types.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>B1</b> &minus; Maintains the security label of each object in the system. Label is used for making decisions to access control.</p></li>
<li><p><b>B2</b> &minus; Extends the sensitivity labels to each system resource, such as storage objects, supports covert channels and auditing of events.</p></li>
<li><p><b>B3</b> &minus; Allows creating lists or user groups for access-control to grant access or revoke access to a given named object.</p></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><p><b>Type C</b></p>
<p>Provides protection and user accountability using audit capabilities. It is of two types.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>C1</b> &minus; Incorporates controls so that users can protect their private information and keep other users from accidentally reading / deleting their data. UNIX versions are mostly Cl class.</p></li>
<li><p><b>C2</b> &minus; Adds an individual-level access control to the capabilities of a Cl level system.</p></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><p><b>Type D</b></p>
<p>Lowest level. Minimum protection. MS-DOS, Window 3.1 fall in this category.</p></td>
</tr>
