<h4>Operating Systems Processes</h4>
<h7>Process</h7>
<p>A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.</p>
<blockquote>A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.</blockquote>
<p>To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.</p>
<p>When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections â”€ stack, heap, text and data. The following image shows a simplified layout of a process inside main memory &minus;</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><p><b>Stack</b></p>
<p>The process Stack contains the temporary data such as method/function parameters, return address and local variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><p><b>Heap</b></p>
<p>This is dynamically allocated memory to a process during its run time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><p><b>Text</b></p>
<p>This includes the current activity represented by the value of Program Counter and the contents of the processor's registers.</p>
</td>

<h7>Program</h7>
<p>A program is a piece of code which may be a single line or millions of lines. A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. For example, here is a simple program written in C programming language &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
   printf("Hello, World! \n");
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. When we compare a program with a process, we can conclude that a process is a dynamic instance of a computer program.</p>
<p>A part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an <b>algorithm</b>. A collection of computer programs, libraries and related data are referred to as a <b>software</b>.</p>
<h7>Process Life Cycle</h7>
<p> When a process executes, it passes through different states. These stages may differ in different operating systems, and the names of these states are also not standardized.</p>
<p>In general, a process can have one of the following five states at a time.</p>
<div align="center"><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:30%; text-align:center;">S.N.</th>
<th style="tstyle=width:30%; text-align:center;">State &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>
<p><b>Start</b></p>
<p>This is the initial state when a process is first started/created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>
<p><b>Ready</b></p>
<p>The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. Ready processes are waiting to have the processor allocated to them by the operating system so that they can run. Process may come into this state after <b>Start</b> state or while running it by but interrupted by the scheduler to assign CPU to some other process.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><p><b>Running</b></p>
<p>Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the OS scheduler, the process state is set to running and the processor executes its instructions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><p><b>Waiting</b></p> 
<p>Process moves into the waiting state if it needs to wait for a resource, such as waiting for user input, or waiting for a file to become available.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><p><b>Terminated or Exit</b></p>
<p>Once the process finishes its execution, or it is terminated by the operating system, it is moved to the terminated state where it waits to be removed from main memory.</p></td>
</tr>

<h7>Process Control Block (PCB)</h7>
<p>A Process Control Block is a data structure maintained by the Operating System for every process. The PCB is identified by an integer process ID (PID). A PCB keeps all the information needed to keep track of a process as listed below in the table &minus;</p>
<div align="center"><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="text-align:center;" class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:30%; text-align:center;">S.N.</th>
<th style="width:30%; text-align:center;">Information &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><p><b>Process State</b></p>
<p>The current state of the process i.e., whether it is ready, running, waiting, or whatever.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><p><b>Process privileges</b></p>
<p>This is required to allow/disallow access to system resources.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><p><b>Process ID</b></p>
<p>Unique identification for each of the process in the operating system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><p><b>Pointer</b></p>
<p>A pointer to parent process.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><p><b>Program Counter</b></p>
<p>Program Counter is a pointer to the address of the next instruction to be executed for this process.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><p><b>CPU registers</b></p>
<p>Various CPU registers where process need to be stored for execution for running state.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td><p><b>CPU Scheduling Information</b></p> 
<p>Process priority and other scheduling information  which is required to schedule the process.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td><p><b>Memory management information</b></p> 
<p>This includes the information of page table, memory limits, Segment table depending on memory used by the operating system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td><p><b>Accounting information</b></p>
<p>This  includes the amount of CPU used for process execution, time limits, execution ID etc.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td><p><b>IO status information</b></p>
<p>This includes a list of I/O devices allocated to the process.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The architecture of a PCB is completely dependent on Operating System and may contain different information in different operating systems. Here is a simplified diagram of a PCB &minus;</p>
<div align="center"><%= image_tag("pcb.jpg", :alt => "PCB") %></div>
<p>The PCB is maintained for a process throughout its lifetime, and is deleted once the process terminates.</p>
